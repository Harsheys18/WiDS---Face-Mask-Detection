# Active Face Mask Detection - Winter in Data Science
The goal of this project is to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in real-time using CCTV footage, supporting Covid-19 safety protocols and ensuring public safety compliance.

## Description
This project is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of Machine Learning in an engaging, hands-on way. If you're new to this field, don’t worry! All you need is a willingness to learn, and we’ll guide you through the rest. Whether you're a beginner or just curious about how face detection works, this project will help you build foundational skills.

## Prerequisites
1. **Basic Python Knowledge**: Understanding variables, loops, and functions will be helpful.
2. **Familiarity with Libraries** _(optional)_: A basic idea of libraries like NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib is a bonus but not mandatory.
3. **Curiosity and Enthusiasm**: A strong interest in learning new concepts is the most important requirement!

## Week 1: Introduction to Image Processing and Data Handling

### Goals
1. Understand the basics of image processing and computer vision.
2. Learn how to handle and preprocess image data.
3. Get comfortable with essential libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Assignments
1. **Basic Image Manipulation with OpenCV**: Write a simple program to load, display, and save images using OpenCV and try some simple image operations(like converting images to grayscale, resizing, and flipping images).
2. **NumPy Array Manipulations**: Write a program to convert an image to a NumPy array and explore basic operations to understand pixel data.
3. **Organizing Data**: Practice organizing images into labeled folders (e.g., `with_mask` and `without_mask`).

4. ***Bonus***: Create a short script to load a batch of images, resize them to 128x128, and convert them to grayscale.
