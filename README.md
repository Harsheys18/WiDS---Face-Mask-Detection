# Active Face Mask Detection - Winter in Data Science

## Description

The Active Face Mask Detection project aims to develop a real-time system that monitors individuals in CCTV footage to determine if they are wearing face masks, in alignment with Covid-19 safety protocols and public safety regulations. Designed to introduce you to essential machine learning concepts through a practical, hands-on approach, this project guides you step-by-step, making it accessible even if you’re new to the field. With just a curiosity to learn, you’ll gain foundational skills in computer vision and real-time video analysis. From understanding the basics of face detection to building a model that identifies mask compliance, this project offers a complete experience that’s as educational as it is relevant to today’s public health needs.

## Prerequisites

1. **CS101 Course**
2. **Basic understanding of Python**: Understanding variables, loops, and functions will be helpful.
3. **Familiarity with Data-analysis Libraries** _(optional)_: A basic idea of libraries like NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib is a bonus but not mandatory.
4. **Curiosity, Enthusiasm and commitment**

## Week 1: Introduction to Image Processing and Data Handling

### Goals

1. Understand the basics of image processing and computer vision.
2. Learn how to handle and preprocess image data.
3. Get comfortable with essential libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Assignments

1. **Basic Image Manipulation with OpenCV**: Write a simple program to load, display, and save images using OpenCV and try some simple image operations(like converting images to grayscale, resizing, and flipping images).
2. **NumPy Array Manipulations**: Write a program to convert an image to a NumPy array and explore basic operations to understand pixel data.
3. **Organizing Data**: Practice organizing images into labeled folders (e.g., `with_mask` and `without_mask`).

4. **_Bonus_**: Create a short script to load a batch of images, resize them to 128x128, and convert them to grayscale.
