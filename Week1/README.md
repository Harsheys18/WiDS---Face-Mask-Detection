# Weekly Focus: Essential Python Libraries for the Project

This week, we will concentrate on mastering some key Python libraries crucial for the project. These libraries include **NumPy**, **OpenCV**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**. Below is a roadmap to guide you through the learning process. If you already learnt this libraries then this week is freebie for you and you can start solving the assignments.

## Roadmap

### Step 1: Learn NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python. Start here to build a strong foundation. Complete as per subdivision shown in W3Schools (you can skip ufunc and random headings)

#### Resources for NumPy:

1. **Official Documentation**: [NumPy Learn](https://numpy.org/learn/)
2. **YouTube Playlist**: [NumPy Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
3. **Web Tutorials**:
   - [W3Schools NumPy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (Comprehensive guide covering almost all topics)

### Step 2: Learn Pandas and Matplotlib

Both libraries are essential for data analysis and visualization. Focus on learning the basic functions of Matplotlib, but allocate most of your time to Pandas for its powerful data manipulation capabilities.

#### Resources for Pandas and Matplotlib:

1. **Official Documentation**:

   - [Matplotlib Tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)
   - [Pandas User Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide)

2. **YouTube Playlists**:

   - [Matplotlib General Plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZOOLe2imFo)
   - [Pandas Basics](https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg?si=zc7XBT6WLFdHRkce)

3. **Web Tutorials**:
   - [W3Schools Matplotlib](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp)
   - [TutorialsPoint Pandas](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/index.htm)

### Step 3: Learn OpenCV

OpenCV is an important library for computer vision tasks. Devote significant time to this step.

#### Resources for OpenCV:

1. **Official Documentation**: [OpenCV Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html)
2. **YouTube Playlists**:
   - [OpenCV Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvYXDBJ5WRDuQRSzFJs93pYR)
   - [OpenCV for Beginners](https://youtu.be/sfheWK72L74?si=TuCINL97hIOP8wCS)
3. **Web Tutorials**:
   - [TutorialsPoint OpenCV](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/opencv/index.htm)
