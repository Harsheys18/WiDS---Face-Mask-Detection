# Introduction to TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This week provides an overview of TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, and its application to building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful class of deep learning models commonly used for image classification, object detection, and various other visual recognition tasks.

TensorFlow and CNNs provide a powerful combination for solving real-world problems related to image and video data. By leveraging TensorFlow's tools and libraries, developers and researchers can easily design, train, and deploy sophisticated machine learning models for a variety of visual tasks.
