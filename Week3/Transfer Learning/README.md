# Transfer Learning

Transfer learning in computer vision involves leveraging pre-trained models, typically trained on large datasets like ImageNet, to solve new, related tasks with smaller datasets. Instead of training a model from scratch, the pre-trained model's knowledge is fine-tuned for the target task by adjusting some or all of its layers. This approach significantly reduces training time and improves performance, especially when data is limited. Transfer learning has proven highly effective in tasks like object detection, image classification, and segmentation, where the features learned from one task can be applied to another.
